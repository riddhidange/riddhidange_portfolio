    </div>
    <p class = intro> 👋 🎓This is Riddhi, a dedicated and driven graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology with a strong
      background in Computer Science, Software Development, and Data Science. Apart from coding, designing, crunching
      numbers, and analyzing data, or pursuing fascinating projects, I also love to expand my cultural horizons by
      attending events, traveling to new places, dancing, or trying out different cuisines.</p>

    <p class = intern> 👩🏻‍🏫 During my internship as a Data Scientist at Myrestica Technologies Pvt. Ltd., I had the opportunity to
      sharpen my skills in a wide range of data science and analysis techniques, including predictive modeling and
      quantitative analysis.I'm passionate about collaborating and actively seek opportunities for engaging projects,
      resulting in successful outcomes.</p>
